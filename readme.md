<h1>Using Blue State Digital as a SQL Developer</h1>

<p>As far as I know, there's no documentation for using Blue State Digital's MySQL replica, which is important for scalable use. This is a little problematic because relatively few people work on BSD data, and trial by getting thrown in the deep end is a good way to get gray hairs at 25. This attempts to fill that gap.</p>

<h2>What's in this repo?</h2>
<p>This repo is divided up into two directories -- a table structure directory, which explains tables related to common and uncommon topics such as constituent data, contribution data, etc., and a folder with sample queries that solve common issues.</p>
<p>These queries assume you are on MySQL wherever possible, unless otherwise noted.</p>

<h2>Please Help, Please</h2>
<p>Contributions from the three other people who work on these issues are welcome! Please make pull requests wherever possible to flesh out or to correct assumptions.</p>
